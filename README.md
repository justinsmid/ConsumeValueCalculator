# ConsumeValueCalculator
This mod will calculate the value of using consume for you. To use it, press the button in the top-right when in-game to bring up the calculations. Alternatively you can press the toggle key (Default "H") to bring up this panel.

You can download and use it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1669664925



Known issues:

-Using the toggle key (Default "H") can cause the game to crash, seemingly if it is done before bringing up the panel by clicking the button.

-Currently does not take orb-triggering effects such as Loop or gold-plated cables into account, will be fixed soon

The code can be found here: https://github.com/justinsmid/ConsumeValueCalculator
